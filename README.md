This project demonstrates a practical, hands-on approach to **Manual Functional Testing** by applying the **Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** across key modules of the **OrangeHRM** application. The primary focus is on the **"My Info"** submodule, with specific attention to upload components like **Photograph** and **Attachments** using **Decision Table Testing**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This manual testing initiative emphasizes a structured testing approach using real-world practices:

- Application Under Test: **OrangeHRM**  
- Demo URL: [OrangeHRM Demo](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com)  
- Type: Human Resource Management System (HRMS)  
- Environment: **Linux**  
- Backend: **PHP**, **MySQL**, served via **Apache HTTP Server**

### 🎯 Objectives

This project simulates a full functional testing workflow, from requirement analysis to test execution, including:

- Building **test scenarios** from **FRS** (Functional Requirement Specifications)
- Designing and documenting **functional test cases**
- Executing test cases with pass/fail results
- Reporting bugs for resolution
- Applying **Decision Table Testing** for testing multi-input components
